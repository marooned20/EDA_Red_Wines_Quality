This repo contains the .rmd and .html file which were part of Udacity's EDA project.  <br>
Under this project, we explore the quality of Red Wine dataset provided by Udacity. <br>

This dataset is public available for research. The details are described in [Cortez et al., 2009].  <br>

Number of Instances: red wine - 1599 <br>
 <br>
The dataset contains: <br>
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): <br>
  1 - fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3) <br>
  2 - volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3) <br>
  3 - citric acid (g / dm^3) <br>
  4 - residual sugar (g / dm^3) <br>
  5 - chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3)  <br>
  6 - free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3) <br>
  7 - total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3) <br>
  8 - density (g / cm^3) <br>
  9 - pH <br>
  10 - sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3) <br>
  11 - alcohol (% by volume) <br>
   <br>
  Output variable (based on sensory data): <br>
  12 - quality (score between 0 and 10) <br>
   <br>
Description of attributes: <br>
  1 - fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily) <br>
  2 - volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste <br>
  3 - citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines <br>
  4 - residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet <br>
  5 - chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine <br>
  6 - free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine <br>
  7 - total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine <br> 
  8 - density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content <br>
  9 - pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale <br>
  10 - sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant <br>
  11 - alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine <br>
  
Output variable (based on sensory data): <br>
  12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
